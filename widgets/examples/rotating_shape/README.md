# Rotating Shape custom widget

This widget allows rotation of arbitrary shapes based on data you send via a channel.

Simply use the attached rotate-shape and group it with your shape to be rotated.
When displayed on a dashboard the rotate-shape will be hidden and your shape will
use the specified property from the received message as the rotation angle.
