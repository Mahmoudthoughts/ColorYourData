# Outdated Sample Indicator custom widget

Use the attached shape and group it with a warning shape (e.g. a red frame around your chart). If samples
do not arrive in the specified time, the warning shape is shown. It disappears, if a new message arrives.

With this widget you can watch a data channel for missing messages and design a warning indicator according
to the style guide of your dashboard.
