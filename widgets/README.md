# Custom Widgets
BVD dashboards can be extended with custom widgets. You write Visio shapes for the dashboard designer and JavaScript code to render widgets inside dashboards using the custom widget API.

The [docs](https://docs.software.hpe.com/BVD/10.63/Content/knowledge_base/widgets/stencil_ref_custom.htm) provide further details including a full API spec.

Pick on of the examples as a starting point for your own first custom widget
