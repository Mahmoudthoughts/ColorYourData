## Working with Examples

The examples need the basic generator to run.
Each example comes with one or more generator config files and Visio/SVG files. To run an example, do the following steps:

1. Get the API key and receiver address of your BVD instance
1. Load the SVG file as a new dashboard in your instance of BVD
1. Edit the generator config file and adapt your key and server address and port
