# Widget Group example

Hint: BVD 10.62 which is shipped with Operations Bridge Suite 2017.08 is provided as containerized version.

With Operations Bridge Suite 2017.08 the widget called Widget Group was introduced as part of the Business Value Dashboard (BVD).

The utilization of the BVD widget group is described in the blog [Utilizing Business Value Dashboard widget group to display a dynamic list of key service metrics](https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/IT-Operations-Management-ITOM/bg-p/sws-571/label-name/operations%20bridge)

Run the example with

<pre>node basicGenerator.js config_group.json</pre>

For instructions to adapt the config file to your own environment, have a look at the [README](https://github.com/MicroFocus/ColorYourData/tree/master/generators/node/examples) one level above

You will see the widget group displaying the dynamic list of services under "Dashboards" in BVD when you select the dashboard "With_Widget_Group".
